# Report on Life Satisfaction and Well-Being Dataset

## 1. Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 2,363 records and 11 variables related to life satisfaction and well-being metrics across various countries, spanning years from 2005 to 2023. The variables include:

- **Country name**: The name of the country (object).
- **Year**: The year of data collection (int).
- **Life Ladder**: A measure of life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10 (float).
- **Log GDP per capita**: The logarithm of GDP per capita (float).
- **Social support**: A measure of perceived social support (float).
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average years of healthy life expectancy (float).
- **Freedom to make life choices**: A measure of personal freedom (float).
- **Generosity**: A measure of altruistic behavior (float).
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Measure of corruption perception (float).
- **Positive affect**: Measure of positive emotions experienced (float).
- **Negative affect**: Measure of negative emotions experienced (float).

### Missing Values
The dataset has several missing values in critical columns:
- Log GDP per capita: 28 missing
- Social support: 13 missing
- Healthy life expectancy at birth: 63 missing
- Freedom to make life choices: 36 missing
- Generosity: 81 missing
- Perceptions of corruption: 125 missing
- Positive affect: 24 missing
- Negative affect: 16 missing

## 2. Analysis Conducted
A variety of analyses and visualizations were conducted to explore relationships among variables, identify trends, and understand the overall dataset's health. Key activities included:

### a. Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was generated to assess the relationships between quantitative variables. This analysis helped highlight which factors are significantly associated with life satisfaction (Life Ladder).

### b. Yearly Trends
By aggregating the data by year, we analyzed trends in life satisfaction, GDP, and other metrics over time to visualize changes.

### c. Country Comparison
The average values of critical indicators were compared across countries to determine which performed best or worst regarding life satisfaction.

### d. Distribution of Variables
Visualizations like histograms and boxplots were created for crucial variables to understand their distributions and identify any outliers.

### e. Missing Values Analysis
A bar chart was used to visualize the extent of missing values in different variables, identifying patterns in missing data.

### f. Regression Analysis
To understand the predictive power of GDP on life satisfaction, a linear regression analysis was performed, establishing a statistical relationship.

## 3. Insights Discovered
- **Correlation Insights**: The analysis indicated a strong positive correlation between "Log GDP per capita" and "Life Ladder," suggesting that wealthier nations tend to report higher life satisfaction.
  
- **Trends Over Time**: The average Life Ladder showed a gradual increase over the years, signaling an improvement in life satisfaction for the global population, potentially aligning with economic growth.

- **Country Performance**: The analysis identified specific countries leading in life satisfaction metrics, with variations highlighting distinct socio-economic contexts.

- **Missing Data Patterns**: Countries with lower GDPs tended to show higher missing values in life satisfaction and related metrics, indicating potential challenges in data collection or reporting.

## 4. Implications and Suggestions
The findings underscore the significant role of economic factors in determining life satisfaction. Policymakers could leverage these insights to improve socio-economic conditions, especially in countries with low life satisfaction scores. Additionally, the need for comprehensive data collection methods is critical to filling gaps and enabling an accurate understanding of global well-being.

### Recommended Next Steps
- **Policy Interventions**: Explore targeted interventions aimed at improving life satisfaction through economic support and community development.
- **Further Research**: Investigate additional factors that might influence life satisfaction beyond those in the dataset, such as cultural aspects or political stability.
- **Data Quality Improvement**: Enhance data collection efforts to minimize missing values, especially in key metrics for future research.
