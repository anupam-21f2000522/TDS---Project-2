# Dataset Report

## 1. Data Overview

The dataset consists of a total of **2652 entries** and **8 features**. Below are the features contained within the dataset:

- **date**: The timestamp associated with each entry (99 missing values).
- **language**: The language of the content.
- **type**: The categorization of the content (e.g., movie).
- **title**: The title of the content.
- **by**: The contributor or creator of the content (262 missing values).
- **overall**: An overall rating (integer).
- **quality**: A quality rating (integer).
- **repeatability**: A repeatability rating (integer).

### Missing Values

The dataset has missing values in the `date` and `by` columns, which could potentially impact the analyses. The specific counts of missing values are as follows:

- `date`: 99 missing
- `by`: 262 missing

## 2. Summary Statistics

### Categorical Features:
- **Language**: There are **11 unique languages** present, with **English** being the most frequent language (count: 1306).
- **Type**: The dataset predominantly comprises **movies** (count: 2211).

### Numerical Features:
- **Overall Rating**: 
  - Mean: 3.05,  
  - Standard Deviation: 0.76,
  - Ratings range from 1 to 5.
  
- **Quality Rating**: 
  - Mean: 3.21,
  - Standard Deviation: 0.80,
  - Ratings range from 1 to 5.

- **Repeatability**: 
  - Mean: 1.49,
  - Standard Deviation: 0.60,
  - Ratings range from 1 to 3.

### Top Contributors
- The dataset includes **1528 unique contributors** with **Kiefer Sutherland** being the most prolific contributor, appearing **48 times**.

## 3. Analysis Conducted

The analysis was organized into several key areas:

### Missing Value Analysis
Identified and assessed the missing data patterns in both the `date` and `by` columns, noting possible implications for overall interpretation.

### Language Impact on Ratings
Utilized ANOVA tests to compare overall ratings across different languages and employed visualization tools to represent this influence more clearly.

### Type Impact on Ratings
Conducted a similar analysis to understand how different types of content (e.g., movies) affect the ratings, especially in terms of quality and repeatability.

### Rating Distribution Visualizations
Generated histograms and box plots to visually analyze the distribution of overall, quality, and repeatability ratings.

### Top Contributor Analysis
Investigated the distribution of contributions from various individuals and assessed how their contributions correlate with quality ratings.

## 4. Insights Discovered

- **Missing Values**: Levels of missing data, particularly in the `by` column, may skew quality ratings if contributors with missing values have varying influences on the dataset.
- **Increased Ratings**: The average ratings are relatively high, indicating a generally positive assessment of the content overall.
- **Language Diversity**: While English is predominant, assessing ratings across different languages can reveal hidden trends and biases.
- **Content Type Predominance**: The dominance of movies prompts further examination regarding quality ratings specific to formats other than movies.
- **Top Contributor Influence**: Notable contributors such as Kiefer Sutherland may influence quality perceptions, warranting deeper investigation into their submissions versus others.

## 5. Visual Interpretation

The following visualizations were created to further support insights:

- **Correlation Matrix** (media\correlation_matrix.png): Illustrates the relationships between overall, quality, and repeatability ratings.
  
- **Missing Values Heatmap** (media\missing_values.png): Displays the pattern of missing values across the dataset.

## Conclusion

The exploratory analysis and visualization tasks have provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and quality. Further investigating the effects of language, type, and contributor performance can enhance insights and direct future content evaluation strategies. Addressing missing values will be crucial when drawing conclusive results. 

By applying the suggested analyses and visualizations, we can gain significant insights that facilitate a deeper understanding of the patterns and relationships within the data, ultimately leading to informed decision-making based on the dataset's findings.
